# HR-Analysis
In this project I personally analyze HR-Analysis and below are my findings:

In HR analysis of employment count, the role of a 'Packaging Associate' has the highest count. This suggests a significant demand for individuals in this position within the organization. The high count may be influenced by factors such as increased production needs, a focus on efficient packaging processes, or a growing demand for products that require extensive packaging.

In the workplace demographic analysis, there are more women than men. This means that a higher percentage of employees are female. Understanding the reasons for this gender distribution can help HR make informed decisions to promote diversity and create an inclusive work environment.

In the workforce age analysis, the age group around 30 has the highest number of employees. This suggests that a significant portion of the workforce is in their thirties. Exploring the reasons for this age distribution can offer insights into hiring patterns, employee retention, and potential areas for professional development tailored to this age group.

# HR-Analysis
In this project I personally analize HR-Analysis and below are my findings:

In HR analysis of employment count, the role of a 'Packaging Associate' has the highest count. This suggests a significant demand for individuals in this position within the organization. The high count may be influenced by factors such as increased production needs, a focus on efficient packaging processes, or a growing demand for products that require extensive packaging.
